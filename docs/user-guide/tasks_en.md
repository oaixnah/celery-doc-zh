# Tasks

Tasks are the building blocks of Celery applications.

A task is a class that can be created out of any callable. It performs dual roles in that it defines both what happens when a task is called (sends a message), and what happens when a worker receives that message.

Every task class has a unique name, and this name is referenced in messages so the worker can find the right function to execute.

A task message is not removed from the queue until that message has been :term:`acknowledged` by a worker. A worker can reserve many messages in advance and even if the worker is killed -- by power failure or some other reason -- the message will be redelivered to another worker.

Ideally task functions should be :term:`idempotent`: meaning the function won't cause unintended effects even if called multiple times with the same arguments. Since the worker cannot detect if your tasks are idempotent, the default behavior is to acknowledge the message in advance, just before it's executed, so that a task invocation that already started is never executed again.

If your task is idempotent you can set the :attr:`~Task.acks_late` option to have the worker acknowledge the message *after* the task returns instead. See also the FAQ entry :ref:`faq-acks_late-vs-retry`.

Note that the worker will acknowledge the message if the child process executing the task is terminated (either by the task calling :func:`sys.exit`, or by signal) even when :attr:`~Task.acks_late` is enabled.  This behavior is intentional as...

1. We don't want to rerun tasks that forces the kernel to send a :sig:`SIGSEGV` (segmentation fault) or similar signals to the process.
2. We assume that a system administrator deliberately killing the task does not want it to automatically restart.
3. A task that allocates too much memory is in danger of triggering the kernel OOM killer, the same may happen again.
4. A task that always fails when redelivered may cause a high-frequency message loop taking down the system.

If you really want a task to be redelivered in these scenarios you should consider enabling the :setting:`task_reject_on_worker_lost` setting.

!!! warning

    A task that blocks indefinitely may eventually stop the worker instance from doing any other work.

    If your task does I/O then make sure you add timeouts to these operations, like adding a timeout to a web request using the :pypi:`requests` library:

    ```python
    connect_timeout, read_timeout = 5.0, 30.0
    response = requests.get(URL, timeout=(connect_timeout, read_timeout))
    ```

    :ref:`Time limits <worker-time-limits>` are convenient for making sure all tasks return in a timely manner, but a time limit event will actually kill the process by force so only use them to detect cases where you haven't used manual timeouts yet.

    In previous versions, the default prefork pool scheduler was not friendly to long-running tasks, so if you had tasks that ran for minutes/hours, it was advised to enable the :option:`-Ofair <celery worker -O>` command-line argument to the :program:`celery worker`. However, as of version 4.0, -Ofair is now the default scheduling strategy. See :ref:`optimizing-prefetch-limit` for more information, and for the best performance route long-running and short-running tasks to dedicated workers (:ref:`routing-automatic`).

    If your worker hangs then please investigate what tasks are running before submitting an issue, as most likely the hanging is caused by one or more tasks hanging on a network operation.

## Basics

You can easily create a task from any callable by using the :meth:`@task` decorator:

```python
from .models import User

@app.task
def create_user(username, password):
    User.objects.create(username=username, password=password)
```

There are also many :ref:`options <task-options>` that can be set for the task, these can be specified as arguments to the decorator:

```python
@app.task(serializer='json')
def create_user(username, password):
    User.objects.create(username=username, password=password)
```


### How do I import the task decorator?

The task decorator is available on your :class:`@Celery` application instance,
if you don't know what this is then please read :ref:`first-steps`.

If you're using Django (see :ref:`django-first-steps`), or you're the author
of a library then you probably want to use the :func:`@shared_task` decorator:

```python
from celery import shared_task

@shared_task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

### Multiple decorators

When using multiple decorators in combination with the task decorator you must make sure that the `task` decorator is applied last (oddly, in Python this means it must be first in the list):

```python
@app.task
@decorator2
@decorator1
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

### Bound tasks

A task being bound means the first argument to the task will always be the task instance (`self`), just like Python bound methods:

```python
logger = get_task_logger(__name__)

@app.task(bind=True)
def add(self, x, y):
    logger.info(self.request.id)
```

Bound tasks are needed for retries (using :meth:`Task.retry() <@Task.retry>`), for accessing information about the current task request, and for any additional functionality you add to custom task base classes.

### Task inheritance

The `base` argument to the task decorator specifies the base class of the task:

```python
import celery

class MyTask(celery.Task):

    def on_failure(self, exc, task_id, args, kwargs, einfo):
        print('{0!r} failed: {1!r}'.format(task_id, exc))

@app.task(base=MyTask)
def add(x, y):
    raise KeyError()
```

## Names

Every task must have a unique name.

If no explicit name is provided the task decorator will generate one for you, and this name will be based on 1) the module the task is defined in, and 2) the name of the task function.

Example setting explicit name:

```pycon
>>> @app.task(name='sum-of-two-numbers')
>>> def add(x, y):
...     return x + y

>>> add.name
'sum-of-two-numbers'
```

A best practice is to use the module name as a name-space, this way names won't collide if there's already a task with that name defined in another module.

```pycon
>>> @app.task(name='tasks.add')
>>> def add(x, y):
...     return x + y
```

You can tell the name of the task by investigating its `.name` attribute:

```pycon
>>> add.name
'tasks.add'
```

The name we specified here (`tasks.add`) is exactly the name that would've been automatically generated for us if the task was defined in a module named :file:`tasks.py`:

```python title="tasks.py"
@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

```pycon
>>> from tasks import add
>>> add.name
'tasks.add'
```

!!! note

    You can use the `inspect` command in a worker to view the names of all registered tasks. See the `inspect registered` command in the :ref:`monitoring-control` section of the User Guide.

### Changing the automatic naming behavior

There are some cases when the default automatic naming isn't suitable. Consider having many tasks within many different modules:

```console
project
├── __init__.py
├── celery.py
├── moduleA
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── tasks.py
└── moduleB
    ├── __init__.py
    └── tasks.py
```

Using the default automatic naming, each task will have a generated name like `moduleA.tasks.taskA`, `moduleA.tasks.taskB`, `moduleB.tasks.test`, and so on. You may want to get rid of having `tasks` in all task names. As pointed above, you can explicitly give names for all tasks, or you can change the automatic naming behavior by overriding :meth:`@gen_task_name`. Continuing with the example, `celery.py` may contain:

```python
from celery import Celery

class MyCelery(Celery):

    def gen_task_name(self, name, module):
        if module.endswith('.tasks'):
            module = module[:-6]
        return super().gen_task_name(name, module)

app = MyCelery('main')
```

So each task will have a name like `moduleA.taskA`, `moduleA.taskB` and `moduleB.test`.

!!! warning

    Make sure that your :meth:`@gen_task_name` is a pure function: meaning that for the same input it must always return the same output.

## Task Request

:attr:`Task.request <@Task.request>` contains information and state related to the currently executing task.

The request defines the following attributes:

| Attributes            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| chord                 | The unique id of the chord this task belongs to (if the task is part of the header).                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Example

An example task accessing information in the context is:

```python
@app.task(bind=True)
def dump_context(self, x, y):
    print('Executing task id {0.id}, args: {0.args!r} kwargs: {0.kwargs!r}'.format(
            self.request))
```

The `bind` argument means that the function will be a "bound method" so that you can access attributes and methods on the task type instance.

## Logging

The worker will automatically set up logging for you, or you can configure logging manually.

A special logger is available named "celery.task", you can inherit from this logger to automatically get the task name and unique id as part of the logs.

The best practice is to create a common logger for all of your tasks at the top of your module:

```python
from celery.utils.log import get_task_logger

logger = get_task_logger(__name__)

@app.task
def add(x, y):
    logger.info('Adding {0} + {1}'.format(x, y))
    return x + y
```

Celery uses the standard Python logger library, and the documentation can be found :mod:`here <logging>`.

You can also use :func:`print`, as anything written to standard out/-err will be redirected to the logging system (you can disable this, see :setting:`worker_redirect_stdouts`).

!!! note

    The worker won't update the redirection if you create a logger instance somewhere in your task or task module.

    If you want to redirect ``sys.stdout`` and ``sys.stderr`` to a custom logger you have to enable this manually, for example:

    ```python
    import sys

    logger = get_task_logger(__name__)

    @app.task(bind=True)
    def add(self, x, y):
        old_outs = sys.stdout, sys.stderr
        rlevel = self.app.conf.worker_redirect_stdouts_level
        try:
            self.app.log.redirect_stdouts_to_logger(logger, rlevel)
            print('Adding {0} + {1}'.format(x, y))
            return x + y
        finally:
            sys.stdout, sys.stderr = old_outs
    ```

!!! note

    If a specific Celery logger you need is not emitting logs, you should check that the logger is propagating properly. In this example "celery.app.trace" is enabled so that "succeeded in" logs are emitted:

    ```python
    import celery
    import logging

    @celery.signals.after_setup_logger.connect
    def on_after_setup_logger(**kwargs):
        logger = logging.getLogger('celery')
        logger.propagate = True
        logger = logging.getLogger('celery.app.trace')
        logger.propagate = True
    ```

!!! note

    If you want to completely disable Celery logging configuration, use the :signal:`setup_logging` signal:

    ```python
    import celery

    @celery.signals.setup_logging.connect
    def on_setup_logging(**kwargs):
        pass
    ```

### Argument checking

Celery will verify the arguments passed when you call the task, just like Python does when calling a normal function:

```pycon
>>> @app.task
... def add(x, y):
...     return x + y

# Calling the task with two arguments works:
>>> add.delay(8, 8)
<AsyncResult: f59d71ca-1549-43e0-be41-4e8821a83c0c>

# Calling the task with only one argument fails:
>>> add.delay(8)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "celery/app/task.py", line 376, in delay
    return self.apply_async(args, kwargs)
  File "celery/app/task.py", line 485, in apply_async
    check_arguments(*(args or ()), **(kwargs or {}))
TypeError: add() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)
```

You can disable the argument checking for any task by setting its :attr:`~@Task.typing` attribute to :const:`False`:

```pycon
>>> @app.task(typing=False)
... def add(x, y):
...     return x + y

# Works locally, but the worker receiving the task will raise an error.
>>> add.delay(8)
<AsyncResult: f59d71ca-1549-43e0-be41-4e8821a83c0c>
```

### Hiding sensitive information in arguments

When using :setting:`task_protocol` 2 or higher (default since 4.0), you can override how positional arguments and keyword arguments are represented in logs and monitoring events using the ``argsrepr`` and ``kwargsrepr`` calling arguments:

```pycon
>>> add.apply_async((2, 3), argsrepr='(<secret-x>, <secret-y>)')

>>> charge.s(account, card='1234 5678 1234 5678').set(
...     kwargsrepr=repr({'card': '**** **** **** 5678'})
... ).delay()
```

!!! warning

    Sensitive information will still be accessible to anyone able to read your task message from the broker, or otherwise able intercept it.

    For this reason you should probably encrypt your message if it contains sensitive information, or in this example with a credit card number the actual number could be stored encrypted in a secure store that you retrieve and decrypt in the task itself.

## Retrying

:meth:`Task.retry() <@Task.retry>` can be used to re-execute the task, for example in the event of recoverable errors.

When you call `retry` it'll send a new message, using the same task-id, and it'll take care to make sure the message is delivered to the same queue as the originating task.

When a task is retried this is also recorded as a task state, so that you can track the progress of the task using the result instance (see :ref:`task-states`).

Here's an example using `retry`:

```python
@app.task(bind=True)
def send_twitter_status(self, oauth, tweet):
    try:
        twitter = Twitter(oauth)
        twitter.update_status(tweet)
    except (Twitter.FailWhaleError, Twitter.LoginError) as exc:
        raise self.retry(exc=exc)
```

!!! note

    The :meth:`Task.retry() <@Task.retry>` call will raise an exception so any code after the retry won't be reached. This is the :exc:`~@Retry` exception, it isn't handled as an error but rather as a semi-predicate to signify to the worker that the task is to be retried, so that it can store the correct state when a result backend is enabled.

    This is normal operation and always happens unless the `throw` argument to retry is set to :const:`False`.

The bind argument to the task decorator will give access to `self` (the task type instance).

The `exc` argument is used to pass exception information that's used in logs, and when storing task results. Both the exception and the traceback will be available in the task state (if a result backend is enabled).

If the task has a `max_retries` value the current exception will be re-raised if the max number of retries has been exceeded, but this won't happen if:

- An `exc` argument wasn't given.

    In this case the :exc:`~@MaxRetriesExceededError` exception will be raised.

- There's no current exception

    If there's no original exception to re-raise the `exc` argument will be used instead, so:

    ```python
    self.retry(exc=Twitter.LoginError())
    ```

    will raise the `exc` argument given.

### Using a custom retry delay

When a task is to be retried, it can wait for a given amount of time before doing so, and the default delay is defined by the :attr:`~@Task.default_retry_delay` attribute. By default this is set to 3 minutes. Note that the unit for setting the delay is in seconds (int or float).

You can also provide the `countdown` argument to :meth:`~@Task.retry` to override this default.

```python
@app.task(bind=True, default_retry_delay=30 * 60)  # retry in 30 minutes.
def add(self, x, y):
    try:
        something_raising()
    except Exception as exc:
        # overrides the default delay to retry after 1 minute
        raise self.retry(exc=exc, countdown=60)
```

### Automatic retry for known exceptions

Sometimes you just want to retry a task whenever a particular exception is raised.

Fortunately, you can tell Celery to automatically retry a task using `autoretry_for` argument in the :meth:`@task` decorator:

```python
from twitter.exceptions import FailWhaleError

@app.task(autoretry_for=(FailWhaleError,))
def refresh_timeline(user):
    return twitter.refresh_timeline(user)
```

If you want to specify custom arguments for an internal :meth:`~@Task.retry` call, pass `retry_kwargs` argument to :meth:`@task` decorator:

```python
@app.task(autoretry_for=(FailWhaleError,), retry_kwargs={'max_retries': 5})
def refresh_timeline(user):
    return twitter.refresh_timeline(user)
```

This is provided as an alternative to manually handling the exceptions, and the example above will do the same as wrapping the task body in a :keyword:`try` ... :keyword:`except` statement:

```python
@app.task
def refresh_timeline(user):
    try:
        twitter.refresh_timeline(user)
    except FailWhaleError as exc:
        raise refresh_timeline.retry(exc=exc, max_retries=5)
```

If you want to automatically retry on any error, simply use:

```python
@app.task(autoretry_for=(Exception,))
def x():
    ...
```

If your tasks depend on another service, like making a request to an API, then it's a good idea to use [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) to avoid overwhelming the service with your requests. Fortunately, Celery's automatic retry support makes it easy. Just specify the :attr:`~Task.retry_backoff` argument, like this:

```python
from requests.exceptions import RequestException

@app.task(autoretry_for=(RequestException,), retry_backoff=True)
def x():
    ...
```

By default, this exponential backoff will also introduce random [jitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff#Jitter) to avoid having all the tasks run at the same moment. It will also cap the maximum backoff delay to 10 minutes. All these settings can be customized via options documented below.

You can also set `autoretry_for`, `max_retries`, `retry_backoff`, `retry_backoff_max` and `retry_jitter` options in class-based tasks:

```python
class BaseTaskWithRetry(Task):
    autoretry_for = (TypeError,)
    max_retries = 5
    retry_backoff = True
    retry_backoff_max = 700
    retry_jitter = False
```

## Argument validation with Pydantic

You can use [Pydantic](https://pydantic.oaix.tech/) to validate and convert arguments as well as serializing results based on typehints by passing `pydantic=True`.

!!! note

    Argument validation only covers arguments/return values on the task side. You still have
    serialize arguments yourself when invoking a task with `delay()` or `apply_async()`.

For example:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ArgModel(BaseModel):
    value: int

class ReturnModel(BaseModel):
    value: str

@app.task(pydantic=True)
def x(arg: ArgModel) -> ReturnModel:
    # args/kwargs type hinted as Pydantic model will be converted
    assert isinstance(arg, ArgModel)

    # The returned model will be converted to a dict automatically
    return ReturnModel(value=f"example: {arg.value}")
```

The task can then be called using a dict matching the model, and you'll receive the returned model "dumped" (serialized using `BaseModel.model_dump()`):

```pycon
>>> result = x.delay({'value': 1})
>>> result.get(timeout=1)
{'value': 'example: 1'}
```

### Union types, arguments to generics

Union types (e.g. `Union[SomeModel, OtherModel]`) or arguments to generics (e.g. `list[SomeModel]`) are **not** supported.

In case you want to support a list or similar types, it is recommended to use `pydantic.RootModel`.


### Optional parameters/return values

Optional parameters or return values are also handled properly. For example, given this task:

```python
from typing import Optional

# models are the same as above

@app.task(pydantic=True)
def x(arg: Optional[ArgModel] = None) -> Optional[ReturnModel]:
    if arg is None:
        return None
    return ReturnModel(value=f"example: {arg.value}")
```

You'll get the following behavior:

```pycon
>>> result = x.delay()
>>> result.get(timeout=1) is None
True
>>> result = x.delay({'value': 1})
>>> result.get(timeout=1)
{'value': 'example: 1'}
```

### Return value handling

Return values will only be serialized if the returned model matches the annotation. If you pass a model instance of a different type, it will *not* be serialized. `mypy` should already catch such errors and you should fix your typehints then.

### Pydantic parameters

There are a few more options influencing Pydantic behavior:

<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>pydantic_strict</td>

</td>
</tr>

<td>
Pass <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/dev/concepts/validators/#validation-context">additional validation context</a> during
Pydantic model validation. The context already includes the application object as
<code>celery_app</code> and the task name as <code>celery_task_name</code> by default.
</td>

<td>pydantic_dump_kwargs</td>
<td>
When serializing a result, pass these additional arguments to <code>dump_kwargs()</code>.
By default, only <code>mode='json'</code> is passed.
</td>

## List of Options

The task decorator can take a number of options that change the way the task behaves, for example you can set the rate limit for a task using the :attr:`rate_limit` option.

Any keyword argument passed to the task decorator will actually be set as an attribute of the resulting task class, and this is a list of the built-in attributes.

### General

<td>The name the task is registered as. <br/><br/>You can set this name manually, or a name will be automatically generated using the module and class name.</td>
</tr>

<td>If the task is being executed this will contain information about the current request. Thread local storage is used.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>max_retries</td>
<td>Only applies if the task calls `self.retry` or if the task is decorated with the :ref:`autoretry_for <task-autoretry>` argument.<br/><br/>The maximum number of attempted retries before giving up. <br/>If the number of retries exceeds this value a :exc:`~@MaxRetriesExceededError` exception will be raised.<br/><br/> The default is `3`. A value of :const:`None` will disable the retry limit and the task will retry forever until it succeeds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>throws</td>
<td>
Optional tuple of expected error classes that shouldn't be regarded as an actual error.<br/><br/>
Errors in this list will be reported as a failure to the result backend, but the worker won't log the event as an error, and no traceback will be included.<br/><br/>
Example:

```python
@task(throws=(KeyError, HttpNotFound)):
def get_foo():
    something()
```

Error types:<br/><br/>

- Expected errors (in ``Task.throws``): Logged with severity ``INFO``, traceback excluded.<br/>
- Unexpected errors: Logged with severity ``ERROR``, with traceback included.
</td>

<tr>
<td>default_retry_delay</td>
<td>Default time in seconds before a retry of the task should be executed. Can be either :class:`int` or :class:`float`. Default is a three minute delay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>rate_limit</td>
<td>
Set the rate limit for this task type (limits the number of tasks that can be run in a given time frame). Tasks will still complete when a rate limit is in effect, but it may take some time before it's allowed to start.<br/><br/>
If this is :const:`None` no rate limit is in effect. If it is an integer or float, it is interpreted as "tasks per second".<br/><br/>
The rate limits can be specified in seconds, minutes or hours by appending `"/s"`, `"/m"` or `"/h"` to the value. Tasks will be evenly distributed over the specified time frame.<br/><br/>
Example: `"100/m"` (hundred tasks a minute). This will enforce a minimum delay of 600ms between starting two tasks on the same worker instance.<br/><br/>
Default is the :setting:`task_default_rate_limit` setting: if not specified means rate limiting for tasks is disabled by default.<br/><br/>
Note that this is a *per worker instance* rate limit, and not a global rate limit. To enforce a global rate limit (e.g., for an API with a maximum number of  requests per second), you must restrict to a given queue.
</td>

## States

Celery can keep track of the tasks current state. The state also contains the result of a successful task, or the exception and traceback information of a failed task.

There are several *result backends* to choose from, and they all have different strengths and weaknesses (see :ref:`task-result-backends`).

During its lifetime a task will transition through several possible states, and each state may have arbitrary meta-data attached to it. When a task moves into a new state the previous state is forgotten about, but some transitions can be deduced, (e.g., a task now in the :state:`FAILED` state, is implied to have been in the :state:`STARTED` state at some point).

There are also sets of states, like the set of :state:`FAILURE_STATES`, and the set of :state:`READY_STATES`.

The client uses the membership of these sets to decide whether the exception should be re-raised (:state:`PROPAGATE_STATES`), or whether the state can be cached (it can if the task is ready).

You can also define :ref:`custom-states`.

### Result Backends

If you want to keep track of tasks or need the return values, then Celery must store or send the states somewhere so that they can be retrieved later. There are several built-in result backends to choose from: SQLAlchemy/Django ORM, Memcached, RabbitMQ/QPid (`rpc`), and Redis -- or you can define your own.

No backend works well for every use case. You should read about the strengths and weaknesses of each backend, and choose the most appropriate for your needs.

!!! warning

    Backends use resources to store and transmit results. To ensure
    that resources are released, you must eventually call
    :meth:`~@AsyncResult.get` or :meth:`~@AsyncResult.forget` on
    EVERY :class:`~@AsyncResult` instance returned after calling
    a task.

.. seealso::

:ref:`conf-result-backend`

#### RPC Result Backend (RabbitMQ/QPid)

The RPC result backend (`rpc://`) is special as it doesn't actually *store* the states, but rather sends them as messages. This is an important difference as it means that a result *can only be retrieved once*, and *only by the client that initiated the task*. Two different processes can't wait for the same result.

Even with that limitation, it is an excellent choice if you need to receive state changes in real-time. Using messaging means the client doesn't have to poll for new states.

The messages are transient (non-persistent) by default, so the results will disappear if the broker restarts. You can configure the result backend to send persistent messages using the :setting:`result_persistent` setting.

#### Database Result Backend

Keeping state in the database can be convenient for many, especially for web applications with a database already in place, but it also comes with limitations.

* Polling the database for new states is expensive, and so you should increase the polling intervals of operations, such as `result.get()`.

* Some databases use a default transaction isolation level that isn't suitable for polling tables for changes.

    In MySQL the default transaction isolation level is `REPEATABLE-READ`: meaning the transaction won't see changes made by other transactions until the current transaction is committed.

    Changing that to the `READ-COMMITTED` isolation level is recommended.

### Built-in States

### Custom states

You can easily define your own states, all you need is a unique name.
The name of the state is usually an uppercase string. As an example
you could have a look at the :mod:`abortable tasks <~celery.contrib.abortable>`
which defines a custom :state:`ABORTED` state.

Use :meth:`~@Task.update_state` to update a task's state:.

```python
@app.task(bind=True)
def upload_files(self, filenames):
    for i, file in enumerate(filenames):
        if not self.request.called_directly:
            self.update_state(state='PROGRESS',
                meta={'current': i, 'total': len(filenames)})
```

Here I created the state `"PROGRESS"`, telling any application
aware of this state that the task is currently in progress, and also where
it is in the process by having `current` and `total` counts as part of the
state meta-data. This can then be used to create progress bars for example.

### Creating pickleable exceptions

A rarely known Python fact is that exceptions must conform to some
simple rules to support being serialized by the pickle module.

Tasks that raise exceptions that aren't pickleable won't work
properly when Pickle is used as the serializer.

To make sure that your exceptions are pickleable the exception
*MUST* provide the original arguments it was instantiated
with in its `.args` attribute. The simplest way
to ensure this is to have the exception call `Exception.__init__`.

Let's look at some examples that work, and one that doesn't:

```python
# OK:
class HttpError(Exception):
    pass

# BAD:
class HttpError(Exception):

    def __init__(self, status_code):
        self.status_code = status_code

# OK:
class HttpError(Exception):

    def __init__(self, status_code):
        self.status_code = status_code
        Exception.__init__(self, status_code)  # <-- REQUIRED
```

So the rule is:
For any exception that supports custom arguments `*args`,
`Exception.__init__(self, *args)` must be used.

There's no special support for *keyword arguments*, so if you
want to preserve keyword arguments when the exception is unpickled
you have to pass them as regular args:

```python
class HttpError(Exception):

    def __init__(self, status_code, headers=None, body=None):
        self.status_code = status_code
        self.headers = headers
        self.body = body

        super(HttpError, self).__init__(status_code, headers, body)
```

## Semipredicates

The worker wraps the task in a tracing function that records the final
state of the task. There are a number of exceptions that can be used to
signal this function to change how it treats the return of the task.

### Ignore

The task may raise :exc:`~@Ignore` to force the worker to ignore the
task. This means that no state will be recorded for the task, but the
message is still acknowledged (removed from queue).

This can be used if you want to implement custom revoke-like
functionality, or manually store the result of a task.

Example keeping revoked tasks in a Redis set:

```python
from celery.exceptions import Ignore

@app.task(bind=True)
def some_task(self):
    if redis.ismember('tasks.revoked', self.request.id):
        raise Ignore()
```

Example that stores results manually:

```python
from celery import states
from celery.exceptions import Ignore

@app.task(bind=True)
def get_tweets(self, user):
    timeline = twitter.get_timeline(user)
    if not self.request.called_directly:
        self.update_state(state=states.SUCCESS, meta=timeline)
    raise Ignore()
```

### Reject

The task may raise :exc:`~@Reject` to reject the task message using
AMQPs `basic_reject` method. This won't have any effect unless
:attr:`Task.acks_late` is enabled.

Rejecting a message has the same effect as acking it, but some
brokers may implement additional functionality that can be used.
For example RabbitMQ supports the concept of [Dead Letter Exchanges](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/dlx)
where a queue can be configured to use a dead letter exchange that rejected
messages are redelivered to.

Reject can also be used to re-queue messages, but please be very careful
when using this as it can easily result in an infinite message loop.

Example using reject when a task causes an out of memory condition:

```python
import errno
from celery.exceptions import Reject

@app.task(bind=True, acks_late=True)
def render_scene(self, path):
    file = get_file(path)
    try:
        renderer.render_scene(file)

    # if the file is too big to fit in memory
    # we reject it so that it's redelivered to the dead letter exchange
    # and we can manually inspect the situation.
    except MemoryError as exc:
        raise Reject(exc, requeue=False)
    except OSError as exc:
        if exc.errno == errno.ENOMEM:
            raise Reject(exc, requeue=False)

    # For any other error we retry after 10 seconds.
    except Exception as exc:
        raise self.retry(exc, countdown=10)
```

Example re-queuing the message:

```python
from celery.exceptions import Reject

@app.task(bind=True, acks_late=True)
def requeues(self):
    if not self.request.delivery_info['redelivered']:
        raise Reject('no reason', requeue=True)
    print('received two times')
```

Consult your broker documentation for more details about the `basic_reject` method.

### Retry

The :exc:`~@Retry` exception is raised by the `Task.retry` method to tell the worker that the task is being retried.

## Custom task classes

All tasks inherit from the :class:`@Task` class. The :meth:`~@Task.run` method becomes the task body.

As an example, the following code,

```python
@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

will do roughly this behind the scenes:

```python
class _AddTask(app.Task):

    def run(self, x, y):
        return x + y
add = app.tasks[_AddTask.name]
```

### Instantiation

A task is **not** instantiated for every request, but is registered
in the task registry as a global instance.

This means that the `__init__` constructor will only be called
once per process, and that the task class is semantically closer to an
Actor.

If you have a task,

```python
from celery import Task

class NaiveAuthenticateServer(Task):

    def __init__(self):
        self.users = {'george': 'password'}

    def run(self, username, password):
        try:
            return self.users[username] == password
        except KeyError:
            return False
```

And you route every request to the same process, then it
will keep state between requests.

This can also be useful to cache resources,
For example, a base Task class that caches a database connection:

```python
from celery import Task

class DatabaseTask(Task):
    _db = None

    @property
    def db(self):
        if self._db is None:
            self._db = Database.connect()
        return self._db
```

#### Per task usage

The above can be added to each task like this:

```python
from celery.app import task

@app.task(base=DatabaseTask, bind=True)
def process_rows(self: task):
    for row in self.db.table.all():
        process_row(row)
```

The `db` attribute of the `process_rows` task will then always stay the same in each process.

#### App-wide usage

You can also use your custom class in your whole Celery app by passing it as
the `task_cls` argument when instantiating the app. This argument should be
either a string giving the python path to your Task class or the class itself:

```python
from celery import Celery

app = Celery('tasks', task_cls='your.module.path:DatabaseTask')
```

This will make all your tasks declared using the decorator syntax within your
app to use your `DatabaseTask` class and will all have a `db` attribute.

The default value is the class provided by Celery: `'celery.app.task:Task'`.

### Handlers

Task handlers are methods that execute at specific points in a task's lifecycle.
All handlers run **synchronously** within the same worker process and thread
that executes the task.

#### Execution timeline

The following diagram shows the exact order of execution:

```text
Worker Process Timeline
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. before_start()      ← Blocks until complete               │
│  2. run()               ← Your task function                  │
│  3. [Result Backend]    ← State + return value persisted      │
│  4. on_success() OR     ← Outcome-specific handler            │
│     on_retry() OR       │                                     │
│     on_failure()        │                                     │
│  5. after_return()      ← Always runs last                    │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

!!! tip
   
    **Key points:**
   
    - All handlers run in the **same worker process** as your task
    - `before_start` **blocks** the task - `run()` won't start until it completes
    - Result backend is updated **before** `on_success`/`on_failure` - other clients can see the task as finished while handlers are still running
    - `after_return` **always** executes, regardless of task outcome

#### Available handlers

**before_start(self, task_id, args, kwargs)**

Run by the worker before the task starts executing.

!!! note

    This handler **blocks** the task: the `run()` method will *not* begin until `before_start` returns.

| param   | description                                         |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| task_id | Unique id of the task to execute.                   |
| args    | Original arguments for the task to execute.         |
| kwargs  | Original keyword arguments for the task to execute. |

The return value of this handler is ignored.

**on_success(self, retval, task_id, args, kwargs)**

Success handler.

Run by the worker if the task executes successfully.

!!! note

    Invoked **after** the task result has already been persisted in the
    result backend. External clients may observe the task as `SUCCESS`
    while this handler is still running.

| param   | description                                       |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| retval  | The return value of the task.                     |
| task_id | Unique id of the executed task.                   |
| args    | Original arguments for the executed task.         |
| kwargs  | Original keyword arguments for the executed task. |

The return value of this handler is ignored.

**on_retry(self, exc, task_id, args, kwargs, einfo)**

Retry handler.

Run by the worker when the task is to be retried.

!!! note

    Invoked **after** the task state has been updated to `RETRY` in the
    result backend but **before** the retry is scheduled.

| param   | description                                      |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| exc     | The exception sent to `retry()`.                 |

| args    | Original arguments for the retried task.         |
| kwargs  | Original keyword arguments for the retried task. |
| einfo   | :class:`~billiard.einfo.ExceptionInfo` instance. |

The return value of this handler is ignored.

**on_failure(self, exc, task_id, args, kwargs, einfo)**

Failure handler.

Run by the worker when the task fails.

!!! note
   
    Invoked **after** the task result has already been persisted in the
    result backend with `FAILURE` state. External clients may observe
    the task as failed while this handler is still running.

| param   | description                                      |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| exc     | The exception raised by the task.                |
| task_id | Unique id of the failed task.                    |
| args    | Original arguments for the failed task.          |

| einfo   | :class:`~billiard.einfo.ExceptionInfo` instance. |

The return value of this handler is ignored.

**after_return(self, status, retval, task_id, args, kwargs, einfo)**

Handler called after the task returns.

!!! note

    Executes **after** `on_success`/`on_retry`/`on_failure`. This is the
    final hook in the task lifecycle and **always** runs, regardless of outcome.

| param   | description                                            |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| status  | Current task state.                                    |
| retval  | Task return value/exception.                           |
| task_id | Unique id of the task.                                 |
| args    | Original arguments for the task that returned.         |
| kwargs  | Original keyword arguments for the task that returned. |
| einfo   | :class:`~billiard.einfo.ExceptionInfo` instance.       |

The return value of this handler is ignored.

### Example usage

```python
import time
from celery import Task

class MyTask(Task):
    
    def before_start(self, task_id, args, kwargs):
        print(f"Task {task_id} starting with args {args}")
        # This blocks - run() won't start until this returns
        
    def on_success(self, retval, task_id, args, kwargs):
        print(f"Task {task_id} succeeded with result: {retval}")
        # Result is already visible to clients at this point
        
    def on_failure(self, exc, task_id, args, kwargs, einfo):
        print(f"Task {task_id} failed: {exc}")
        # Task state is already FAILURE in backend
        
    def after_return(self, status, retval, task_id, args, kwargs, einfo):
        print(f"Task {task_id} finished with status: {status}")
        # Always runs last

@app.task(base=MyTask)
def my_task(x, y):
    return x + y
```

### Requests and custom requests

Upon receiving a message to run a task, the `worker <guide-workers>`:ref:
creates a `request <celery.worker.request.Request>`:class: to represent such
demand.

Custom task classes may override which request class to use by changing the
attribute `celery.app.task.Task.Request`:attr:.  You may either assign the
custom request class itself, or its fully qualified name.

The request has several responsibilities.  Custom request classes should cover
them all -- they are responsible to actually run and trace the task.  We
strongly recommend to inherit from `celery.worker.request.Request`:class:.

When using the `pre-forking worker <worker-concurrency>`:ref:, the methods
`~celery.worker.request.Request.on_timeout`:meth: and
`~celery.worker.request.Request.on_failure`:meth: are executed in the main
worker process.  An application may leverage such facility to detect failures
which are not detected using `celery.app.task.Task.on_failure`:meth:.

As an example, the following custom request detects and logs hard time
limits, and other failures.

```python
import logging
from celery import Task
from celery.worker.request import Request

logger = logging.getLogger('my.package')

class MyRequest(Request):
   'A minimal custom request to log failures and hard time limits.'

   def on_timeout(self, soft, timeout):
       super(MyRequest, self).on_timeout(soft, timeout)
       if not soft:
          logger.warning(
              'A hard timeout was enforced for task %s',
              self.task.name
          )

   def on_failure(self, exc_info, send_failed_event=True, return_ok=False):
       super().on_failure(
           exc_info,
           send_failed_event=send_failed_event,
           return_ok=return_ok
       )
       logger.warning(
           'Failure detected for task %s',
           self.task.name
       )

class MyTask(Task):
   Request = MyRequest  # you can use a FQN 'my.package:MyRequest'

@app.task(base=MyTask)
def some_longrunning_task():
   # use your imagination
```

## How it works

Here come the technical details. This part isn't something you need to know,
but you may be interested.

All defined tasks are listed in a registry. The registry contains
a list of task names and their task classes. You can investigate this registry
yourself:

```pycon
>>> from proj.celery import app
>>> app.tasks
{'celery.chord_unlock':
    <@task: celery.chord_unlock>,
 'celery.backend_cleanup':
    <@task: celery.backend_cleanup>,
 'celery.chord':
    <@task: celery.chord>}
```

This is the list of tasks built into Celery. Note that tasks
will only be registered when the module they're defined in is imported.

The default loader imports any modules listed in the
:setting:`imports` setting.

The :meth:`@task` decorator is responsible for registering your task
in the applications task registry.

When tasks are sent, no actual function code is sent with it, just the name
of the task to execute. When the worker then receives the message it can look
up the name in its task registry to find the execution code.

This means that your workers should always be updated with the same software
as the client. This is a drawback, but the alternative is a technical
challenge that's yet to be solved.

## Tips and Best Practices

### Ignore results you don't want

If you don't care about the results of a task, be sure to set the
:attr:`~@Task.ignore_result` option, as storing results
wastes time and resources.

```python
@app.task(ignore_result=True)
def mytask():
    something()
```

Results can even be disabled globally using the :setting:`task_ignore_result` setting.

Results can be enabled/disabled on a per-execution basis, by passing the `ignore_result` boolean parameter, when calling `apply_async`.

```python
@app.task
def mytask(x, y):
    return x + y

# No result will be stored
result = mytask.apply_async((1, 2), ignore_result=True)
print(result.get()) # -> None

# Result will be stored
result = mytask.apply_async((1, 2), ignore_result=False)
print(result.get()) # -> 3
```

By default tasks will *not ignore results* (`ignore_result=False`) when a result backend is configured.

The option precedence order is the following:

1. Global :setting:`task_ignore_result`
2. :attr:`~@Task.ignore_result` option
3. Task execution option ``ignore_result``

### More optimization tips

You find additional optimization tips in the
:ref:`Optimizing Guide <guide-optimizing>`.

### Avoid launching synchronous subtasks

Having a task wait for the result of another task is really inefficient,
and may even cause a deadlock if the worker pool is exhausted.

Make your design asynchronous instead, for example by using *callbacks*.

**Bad**:

```python
@app.task
def update_page_info(url):
    page = fetch_page.delay(url).get()
    info = parse_page.delay(page).get()
    store_page_info.delay(url, info)

@app.task
def fetch_page(url):
    return myhttplib.get(url)

@app.task
def parse_page(page):
    return myparser.parse_document(page)

@app.task
def store_page_info(url, info):
    return PageInfo.objects.create(url, info)
```

**Good**:

```python
def update_page_info(url):
    # fetch_page -> parse_page -> store_page
    chain = fetch_page.s(url) | parse_page.s() | store_page_info.s(url)
    chain()

@app.task()
def fetch_page(url):
    return myhttplib.get(url)

@app.task()
def parse_page(page):
    return myparser.parse_document(page)

@app.task(ignore_result=True)
def store_page_info(info, url):
    PageInfo.objects.create(url=url, info=info)
```

Here I instead created a chain of tasks by linking together
different :func:`~celery.signature`'s.
You can read about chains and other powerful constructs
at :ref:`designing-workflows`.

By default Celery will not allow you to run subtasks synchronously within a task,
but in rare or extreme cases you might need to do so.
**WARNING**:
enabling subtasks to run synchronously is not recommended!

```python
@app.task
def update_page_info(url):
    page = fetch_page.delay(url).get(disable_sync_subtasks=False)
    info = parse_page.delay(page).get(disable_sync_subtasks=False)
    store_page_info.delay(url, info)

@app.task
def fetch_page(url):
    return myhttplib.get(url)

@app.task
def parse_page(page):
    return myparser.parse_document(page)

@app.task
def store_page_info(url, info):
    return PageInfo.objects.create(url, info)
```

## Performance and Strategies

### Granularity

The task granularity is the amount of computation needed by each subtask.
In general it is better to split the problem up into many small tasks rather
than have a few long running tasks.

With smaller tasks you can process more tasks in parallel and the tasks
won't run long enough to block the worker from processing other waiting tasks.

However, executing a task does have overhead. A message needs to be sent, data
may not be local, etc. So if the tasks are too fine-grained the
overhead added probably removes any benefit.

.. seealso::

The book `Art of Concurrency`_ has a section dedicated to the topic
of task granularity [AOC1][^1].

### Data locality

The worker processing the task should be as close to the data as
possible. The best would be to have a copy in memory, the worst would be a
full transfer from another continent.

If the data is far away, you could try to run another worker at location, or
if that's not possible - cache often used data, or preload data you know
is going to be used.

The easiest way to share data between workers is to use a distributed cache
system, like [memcached](https://memcached.org/).

.. seealso::

The paper [Distributed Computing Economics](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/distributed-computing-economics/) by Jim Gray is an excellent
introduction to the topic of data locality.

### State

Since Celery is a distributed system, you can't know which process, or
on what machine the task will be executed. You can't even know if the task will
run in a timely manner.

The ancient async sayings tells us that “asserting the world is the
responsibility of the task”. What this means is that the world view may
have changed since the task was requested, so the task is responsible for
making sure the world is how it should be;  If you have a task
that re-indexes a search engine, and the search engine should only be
re-indexed at maximum every 5 minutes, then it must be the tasks
responsibility to assert that, not the callers.

Another gotcha is Django model objects. They shouldn't be passed on as
arguments to tasks. It's almost always better to re-fetch the object from
the database when the task is running instead,  as using old data may lead
to race conditions.

Imagine the following scenario where you have an article and a task
that automatically expands some abbreviations in it:

```python
class Article(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField()
    body = models.TextField()

@app.task
def expand_abbreviations(article):
    article.body.replace('MyCorp', 'My Corporation')
    article.save()
```

First, an author creates an article and saves it, then the author
clicks on a button that initiates the abbreviation task:

```pycon
>>> article = Article.objects.get(id=102)
>>> expand_abbreviations.delay(article)
```

Now, the queue is very busy, so the task won't be run for another 2 minutes.
In the meantime another author makes changes to the article, so
when the task is finally run, the body of the article is reverted to the old
version because the task had the old body in its argument.

Fixing the race condition is easy, just use the article id instead, and
re-fetch the article in the task body:

```python
@app.task
def expand_abbreviations(article_id):
    article = Article.objects.get(id=article_id)
    article.body.replace('MyCorp', 'My Corporation')
    article.save()
```

```pycon
>>> expand_abbreviations.delay(article_id)
```

There might even be performance benefits to this approach, as sending large
messages may be expensive.

### Database transactions

Let's have a look at another example:

```python
from django.db import transaction
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

@transaction.atomic
def create_article(request):
    article = Article.objects.create()
    expand_abbreviations.delay(article.pk)
    return HttpResponseRedirect('/articles/')
```

This is a Django view creating an article object in the database,
then passing the primary key to a task. It uses the `transaction.atomic`
decorator, that will commit the transaction when the view returns, or
roll back if the view raises an exception.

There is a race condition because transactions are atomic. This means the article object is not persisted to the database until after the view function returns a response. If the asynchronous task starts executing before the transaction is committed, it may attempt to query the article object before it exists. To prevent this, we need to ensure that the transaction is committed before triggering the task.

The solution is to use
:meth:`~celery.contrib.django.task.DjangoTask.delay_on_commit` instead:

```python
from django.db import transaction
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

@transaction.atomic
def create_article(request):
    article = Article.objects.create()
    expand_abbreviations.delay_on_commit(article.pk)
    return HttpResponseRedirect('/articles/')
```

This method was added in Celery 5.4. It's a shortcut that uses Django's
`on_commit` callback to launch your Celery task once all transactions
have been committed successfully.

#### With Celery <5.4

If you're using an older version of Celery, you can replicate this behaviour
using the Django callback directly as follows:

```python
import functools
from django.db import transaction
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

@transaction.atomic
def create_article(request):
    article = Article.objects.create()
    transaction.on_commit(
        functools.partial(expand_abbreviations.delay, article.pk)
    )
    return HttpResponseRedirect('/articles/')
```

!!! note

    `on_commit` is available in Django 1.9 and above, if you are using a
    version prior to that then the [django-transaction-hooks](https://github.com/carljm/django-transaction-hooks)
    library adds support for this.

## Example

Let's take a real world example: a blog where comments posted need to be
filtered for spam. When the comment is created, the spam filter runs in the
background, so the user doesn't have to wait for it to finish.

I have a Django blog application allowing comments
on blog posts. I'll describe parts of the models/views and tasks for this
application.

### `blog/models.py`

The comment model looks like this:

```python
from django.db import models
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _


class Comment(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(_('name'), max_length=64)
    email_address = models.EmailField(_('email address'))
    homepage = models.URLField(_('home page'), blank=True, verify_exists=False)
    comment = models.TextField(_('comment'))
    pub_date = models.DateTimeField(_('Published date'), editable=False, auto_add_now=True)
    is_spam = models.BooleanField(_('spam?'), default=False, editable=False)

    class Meta:
        verbose_name = _('comment')
        verbose_name_plural = _('comments')
```

In the view where the comment is posted, I first write the comment
to the database, then I launch the spam filter task in the background.

### `blog/views.py`

```python
from django import forms
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
from django.template.context import RequestContext
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render_to_response

from blog import tasks
from blog.models import Comment


class CommentForm(forms.ModelForm):

    class Meta:
        model = Comment


def add_comment(request, slug, template_name='comments/create.html'):
    post = get_object_or_404(Entry, slug=slug)
    remote_addr = request.META.get('REMOTE_ADDR')

    if request.method == 'post':
        form = CommentForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
        if form.is_valid():
            comment = form.save()
            # Check spam asynchronously.
            tasks.spam_filter.delay(comment_id=comment.id,
                                    remote_addr=remote_addr)
            return HttpResponseRedirect(post.get_absolute_url())
    else:
        form = CommentForm()

    context = RequestContext(request, {'form': form})
    return render_to_response(template_name, context_instance=context)
```

To filter spam in comments I use [Akismet](http://akismet.com/faq/), the service
used to filter spam in comments posted to the free blog platform
[Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/). [Akismet](http://akismet.com/faq/) is free for personal use, but for commercial use you
need to pay. You have to sign up to their service to get an API key.

To make API calls to [Akismet](http://akismet.com/faq/) I use the [akismet.py](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/downloads/akismet.py) library written by
[Michael Foord](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/).

### `blog/tasks.py`

```python
from celery import Celery

from akismet import Akismet

from django.core.exceptions import ImproperlyConfigured
from django.contrib.sites.models import Site

from blog.models import Comment


app = Celery(broker='amqp://')


@app.task
def spam_filter(comment_id, remote_addr=None):
    logger = spam_filter.get_logger()
    logger.info('Running spam filter for comment %s', comment_id)

    comment = Comment.objects.get(pk=comment_id)
    current_domain = Site.objects.get_current().domain
    akismet = Akismet(settings.AKISMET_KEY, 'http://{0}'.format(domain))
    if not akismet.verify_key():
        raise ImproperlyConfigured('Invalid AKISMET_KEY')


    is_spam = akismet.comment_check(user_ip=remote_addr,
                        comment_content=comment.comment,
                        comment_author=comment.name,
                        comment_author_email=comment.email_address)
    if is_spam:
        comment.is_spam = True
        comment.save()

    return is_spam
```
